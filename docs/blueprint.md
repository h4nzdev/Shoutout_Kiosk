# **App Name**: CCS Valentine Shoutout

## Core Features:

- Shoutout Input: Allow users to input text for the shoutout message and upload an image to be displayed with the message.
- Frame Selection: Enable users to select a decorative frame to surround their shoutout, adding a personalized visual touch.
- Shoutout Display: Display the formatted shoutout with the text, image, and selected frame on the screen.
- Shoutout Categorization: Automatically order or categorize the shoutouts for easy browsing (e.g., by submission time or popularity).
- Ephemeral Shoutout: Implement a setting that sets a TTL(Time To Live) so that any messages or files that have exceeded this threshold can be immediately purged from localStorage using appropriate events. Once it is above threshold, immediately purge and fire notification that localStorage has changed

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#DC143C) for a Valentine's theme that acknowledges CSS's black while being engaging.
- Background color: Near-black (#1A1A1A) to allude to College of Computer Studies identity. Chosen for a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF), placed in the analogous position (about 30 degrees to the 'left' on the color wheel).
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' for headlines, a sans-serif. 'Inter' for body text, also sans-serif. 
- Use heart-shaped icons and CSS-themed icons such as curly braces, or code snippets, for interactive elements.
- A clean and modern layout with clear sections for input, image upload, and display, with smooth transitions and animations.
- Incorporate subtle animations on the shoutout display and transitions for a visually appealing user experience.
